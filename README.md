# Cook Recipe App

Cook Recipe App is a mobile application built using React Native for Android and iOS. It allows users to explore and discover recipes based on different categories, view recipe details, and access ingredients, directions, and nutritional information.

## Features

- **Recent Recipes**: Displays the most recent 5 recipes for quick access.
- **Explore**: Provides a list of recipe categories for users to browse.
- **Category Recipes**: Upon selecting a category, a list of recipes within that category is displayed.
- **Recipe Details**: Each recipe includes an image, ingredients, directions, and nutritional information.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is designed to work seamlessly on both Android and iOS devices.

## Installation

To run the app locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Hussein-Abdallah/cook-recipe-app.git
   ```
2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd cook-recipe-app
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
4. Use a compatible mobile emulator or connect a physical device to run the app. Alternatively, you can install the Expo Go app on your Android or iOS device and scan the QR code provided in the development server to open the app.

## Sample Data

This application is a pure frontend implementation, and the data used for recipes and categories is being retrieved from a JSON file included within the project. The purpose of this data is to provide a sample representation of recipe content and demonstrate the functionality of the app.

Please note that the JSON file is used for demonstration purposes only and does not reflect a live or dynamic data source. It can be found in the `src/data` directory of the project.

If you wish to modify or add new data, you can edit the JSON file directly or integrate the app with a backend server to fetch data from a live API.
